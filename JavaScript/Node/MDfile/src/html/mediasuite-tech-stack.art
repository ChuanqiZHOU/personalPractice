<h1 id="technologies-we-use">Technologies we use</h1>
<p>Here at Media Suite we use a range of technologies for our web applications.  Many of our large bespoke projects typically use either Loopback or Django on the server, and <a href="https://www.emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, React or Angular on the client. However, we also have a large number of exciting projects that make use of SilverStripe, a PHP framework designed and built right here in New Zealand.</p>
